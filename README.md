# 🧠 Image Classification using Teachable Machine & Google Colab

## 📌 Project Summary

This project is an image classification model built using **Google Teachable Machine**, enhanced and tested through **Google Colab**. It classifies images into two main categories:

- 🌟 **Starfish**
- 🐚 **Seashells**

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

### 🔸 Class 1: `starfish`
- Contains 5 image samples of starfish on sand and beach backgrounds.
- Images were uploaded manually via the interface.

### 🔸 Class 2: `seashells`
- Contains 5 image samples of various seashells in natural scenes.
- Samples include different shapes, textures, and lighting.

## 🏋️ Model Training

- The model was trained using **Teachable Machine’s** built-in training system.
- A basic configuration was used (no advanced settings changed).
- The model was trained directly in the browser using uploaded image samples.

---

## 🧪 Model Testing

- Testing was conducted using a sample image of seashells.
- ✅ **Prediction Output:** The model successfully identified the image as `seashells` with **100% confidence**.
